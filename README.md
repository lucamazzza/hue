-----------

HUE is a funny videogame developed for an academical course about game development.
It is the effort of 4 people to produce something original and funny.
This effort led to the creation of a quirky carboard world filled with jolly animals and monsters
that make for an awesome RP adventure.

HUE is made with Unity and therefore can possibly run on any hardware supported by the aforementioned 
game engine, when built with the right settings.
